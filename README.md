# @viviswapcom/api-integration-demo

This repository contains a very basic example integration of the [viviswap:api](https://docs.viviswap.com/).

You can see the relevant examples in the directory with equal name.
[./examples](./examples)

To run the examples you just have to rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the required values with your custom keys.
You can register and create your own api credentials at [viviswap.com](https://viviswap.com).

If you need further assistance or have any questions don't hesitate to contact us at <support@viviswap.com> or vivist <https://viviswap.com/support>.

Happy hacking!
